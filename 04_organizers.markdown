[**Jonathan Brachthäuser**](https://se.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/team/brachthaeuser/) is Junior Professor at the University of Tübingen, Germany. 
He is one of the authors of the [Effekt language](https://effekt-lang.org) a language with effects and handlers, and involved in joint efforts to bring effect safety to the Scala language.
His research revolves around alternative, lightweight effect systems as well as efficient implementation techniques for effect handlers---a mechanism to structure advanced control-flow patterns.

[**Youyou Cong**](https://prg.is.titech.ac.jp/people/cong/) is an Assistant Professor at Tokyo Institute of Technology, Japan.  She has been studying the theory of delimited control operators, with a special focus on their type systems and CPS translations.  Her recent work applies the knowledge gained in the control operators research to effect handlers, using the strong connection between the two effect facilities.

[**Jeremy Gibbons**](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/jeremy.gibbons/) is Professor of Computing at the University of Oxford, where he leads the [Algebra of Programming](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/activities/algprog/) research group and directs the [Professional Master’s Programme](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/softeng/). His research interests are in reasoning about programs, in particular programs with effects.
