## Discussants

Each technical session will have one person nominated as a *discussant*. The responsibility of this role is to end the session by responding to the presentations in that session. This might be to provide a personal comment on the presentation; it might be to explain some of the context; it might be to raise some questions, or even (constructively!) criticize the presentation or point at shortcomings. 
advance.

The goal of the discussant's time is to spark discussion. This can be discussion between them and the presenter, but it's even better if they can manage to draw the audience into the discussion. The point is to help everyone think about and reflect upon the presentations that have just taken place. It also serves to enhance the workshop feel, with more people engaging in discussion and discussing the impact of the work being presented as well as potential unsolved problems.

Please contact us if you would like to volunteer as discussant for a particular session. We will volunteer people on Monday morning to fill the remaining discussant roles.


## Fishbowl conversations

There are *panel discussions* at the end of Tuesday and Thursday. We have allocated an hour for each of these, but in a two-hour session at the end of the day. The idea here is that if the discussion has run its course after an hour, we have time to relax and chat before dinner; if the discussion is still going, yet you've have enough for the day, you can leave with honour after an hour; but we hopefully do not need to impose a hard stop and stifle a lively discussion.

We will organize these panels as [fishbowl discussions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishbowl_(conversation)). The panel will be initialized with five "fish", but six chairs; at any point, anyone else can join the fishbowl to speak, and one of the current fish must volunteer to leave. The point is to allow everyone to have a say. The initial fish are: Ningning, KC, Sam, Taro, Philipp on Tuesday; Nick, Shin-ya, Eli, Yukiyoshi, Cameron on Thursday.
